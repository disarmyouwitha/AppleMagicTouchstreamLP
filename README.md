# AppleMagicTouchstreamLP

## Usage
This is the landing page for 2 different projects that I will include as submodules if you want the source code for either OSX or Windows versions, but primarily as a place to post the Release files.

**OSX:** https://github.com/disarmyouwitha/GlassToKey

**Win:** https://github.com/disarmyouwitha/GlassToKeyForWindows

## Intention
An attempt to use the Apple Magic Trackpad as a keyboard (and mouse!) like the TouchStream LP~
Since it is built on the same technology, I thought it would be fun to try and create an open source version!

100% unaffiliated **BUT** I did order some really dope custom decals from here and they were **perfect**!
