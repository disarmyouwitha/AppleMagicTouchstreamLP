# AppleMagicTouchstreamLP
Consolidating GlassToKey and GlassToKeyForWindows into 1 repo with a much better name! 

## OSX: **(Packaged with .DMG)**
- Built on top of the wonderful 
- https://github.com/Kyome22/OpenMultitouchSupport

## WIN: **(PRE-REQUISITE INSTALL)**
- Built on top of the Official Apple Bootcamp drivers:
- **https://github.com/lc700x/MagicTrackPad2_Windows_Precision_Drivers/releases**
- OR https://github.com/vitoplantamura/MagicTrackpad2ForWindows (No Bluetooth support for USB-C)
- *If you Install an open source driver, if you use the DLLs included in `articafacts/DLLs` I have hacked pressure data into the PTP_REPORT! I hope to enable Haptics via this route but I have had **NO** luck.*

## Usage
I will post a release with a .dmg and .exe file and hopefully people will be able to run it! I cannot confirm it will work for anyone else~ This is just a fun side project I am working on with Codex so it's something you might have to fork and extend!

## Intention
An attempt to use the Apple Magic Trackpad as a keyboard (and mouse!) like the TouchStream LP~
Since it is built on the same technology, I thought it would be fun to try and create an open source version!
