## TODO
- Can you move Gesture Tuning out from inside of Typing tuning into it's own section between Typing Tuning and Mode Toggles?
- In the Action / Hold / Gesture dropdown (All pulled from the same list) the order should go: General, Letters A-Z, Numbers 0-9, Navigation, Modifiers, Symbols, CMD Shortcuts, Layers and then Gestures
---
- Left / Right / Double Click actions in Action Dropdown
- What actions can we add?
---
- 4-finger hold should only apply after Hold (ms) **UNLESS CHORDAL SHIFT IS SELECTED, WHICH SHOULD APPLY INSTANTLY**
-------
- Build out Gestures sub-collapsable menues: Holds, Corners, Clicks, Force Clicks
- Implement Auto Splay
- Implement e v e n s p a c i n g
-------
- export /import keymaps, **load GLASSTOKEY_DEFAULT_KEYMAP.json (package with app) if no keymap is saved.
- autocorrect bugging (lets go symspell)
- * far future - keymap import/export on windows/osx interop?
- Fix Planck layout
- auto-reconnect not working?
- Short drag sometimes fires click
- not sure it should be able to go into gesture mode during typing intent/typing grace
- sometimes click types letters (Lifting fingers after tap)

- Replay genius: If you want, I can also add replay hotkeys (Space play/pause, arrow keys frame step).
