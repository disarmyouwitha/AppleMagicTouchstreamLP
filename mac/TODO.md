## TODO
- Outer Corners should be added to the Gesture Tuning > Holds menu, and it should be configurable. (Right now it is Dictation, add Dictation to the Action dropdown as 'Voice')
- Add Inner Corners hold.
- Add 2,3,4-Finger Hold Gestures!
- Add gestures (and collapsable sub-menu) to Gesture Tuning: Corners, Clicks, Force Clicks
---
- Double Click action in Action Dropdowns
- What actions can we add?
---
- 4-finger hold should only apply after Hold (ms) **UNLESS CHORDAL SHIFT IS SELECTED, WHICH SHOULD APPLY INSTANTLY**
-------
- Implement Auto Splay
- Implement e v e n s p a c i n g
-------
- * Can MAKE NOTE ONLY of any migration/legacy code we are not using or that was used to transition to our current architecture? We are about to have our first release, so there are no users with "legacy" settings and we don't need to support anything legacy
- export /import keymaps, **load GLASSTOKEY_DEFAULT_KEYMAP.json (package with app) if no keymap is saved.
- autocorrect bugging (lets go symspell)
- * far future - keymap import/export on windows/osx interop?
- Fix Planck layout
- auto-reconnect not working?
- Short drag sometimes fires click
- not sure it should be able to go into gesture mode during typing intent/typing grace
- sometimes click types letters (Lifting fingers after tap)
###
# HUGE:

- normalize keymap for 6x3 5x3 where it looks the same minus outer column.
###
- "Autosplay" set column x,y based on finger splay "4 finger touch" snapsMetro.
- e v e n s p a c e

- Replay genius: If you want, I can also add replay hotkeys (Space play/pause, arrow keys frame step).
