- Implement Auto Splay

- Please explain to me how haptics works in the framework. Is this portable to windows in any way? Do you think it would be possible to implement in windows by reverse engineering?
-------
- export /import keymaps, **load global.json default
- autocorrect bugging (lets go symspell)
- auto-reconnect not working?
- Short drag sometimes fires click
- not sure it should be able to go into gesture mode during typing intent/typing grace
- sometimes click types letters (Lifting fingers after tap)
