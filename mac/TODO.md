## TODO
- Add/fix double-click
- Add 2,3,4-Finger Hold Gestures!
- Add gestures (and collapsable sub-menu) to Gesture Tuning: Corners, Clicks, Force Clicks
---
- 4-finger hold should only apply after Hold (ms) **UNLESS CHORDAL SHIFT IS SELECTED, WHICH SHOULD APPLY INSTANTLY**
- What other actions can we add?
-------
- Implement Auto Splay
- Implement e v e n s p a c i n g
-------
- Can we make Gesture Tuning section scrollable??
- * Can MAKE NOTE ONLY of any migration/legacy code we are not using or that was used to transition to our current architecture? We are about to have our first release, so there are no users with "legacy" settings and we don't need to support anything legacy
- export /import keymaps, **load GLASSTOKEY_DEFAULT_KEYMAP.json (package with app) if no keymap is saved.
- autocorrect bugging (lets go symspell)
- * far future - keymap import/export on windows/osx interop?
- Fix Planck layout
- auto-reconnect not working?
- Short drag sometimes fires click
---
- not sure it should be able to go into gesture mode during typing intent/typing grace
- sometimes click types letters (Lifting fingers after tap)
# HUGE:
- normalize %!??
- normalize keymap for 6x3 5x3 where it looks the same minus outer column.
###
- Replay Addition: Add replay hotkeys (Space play/pause, arrow keys frame step).
