## TODO
- Can we move Tap Cadence right below Hold Duration
- Can you find somewhere nice to put Peak force? in Windows we added it to the bototm 
- Build out Gestures sub-collapsable menues: Holds, Corners, Clicks, Force Clicks
- Haptic Strength (This goes 1-6 we should change scale)
---
- Double Click action in Action Dropdowns
- What actions can we add?
---
- 4-finger hold should only apply after Hold (ms) **UNLESS CHORDAL SHIFT IS SELECTED, WHICH SHOULD APPLY INSTANTLY**
-------
- Implement Auto Splay
- Implement e v e n s p a c i n g
-------
- export /import keymaps, **load GLASSTOKEY_DEFAULT_KEYMAP.json (package with app) if no keymap is saved.
- autocorrect bugging (lets go symspell)
- * far future - keymap import/export on windows/osx interop?
- Fix Planck layout
- auto-reconnect not working?
- Short drag sometimes fires click
- not sure it should be able to go into gesture mode during typing intent/typing grace
- sometimes click types letters (Lifting fingers after tap)
###
