## TODO
# Gesture config:
- Create a Gesture Tuning section under Typing Tuning that is collapsable
- Create dropdown for each of my gestures and implement them as actions that can be selected from a drop down. (You can reference ../windows/glasstokey to see how this was done if you need!) Please add a dropdown selection for each Gesture we currently have implemented: "2-finger tap" (Left Click), "3-finger tap" (Right Click), "4-finger hold" (Chordal Shift), and "5-finger swipe left" and "5-finger swipe right" (Typing Toggle)
---
- Left / Right / Double Click actions in Action Dropdown
- What actions can we add?
-------
- Implement Auto Splay
- Implement e v e n s p a c i n g
-------
- export /import keymaps, **load GLASSTOKEY_DEFAULT_KEYMAP.json (package with app) if no keymap is saved.
- autocorrect bugging (lets go symspell)
- * far future - keymap import/export on windows/osx interop?
- Fix Planck layout
- auto-reconnect not working?
- Short drag sometimes fires click
- not sure it should be able to go into gesture mode during typing intent/typing grace
- sometimes click types letters (Lifting fingers after tap)
###
# HUGE:

- normalize keymap for 6x3 5x3 where it looks the same minus outer column.
###
- "Autosplay" set column x,y based on finger splay "4 finger touch" snapsMetro.
- e v e n s p a c e

- Replay genius: If you want, I can also add replay hotkeys (Space play/pause, arrow keys frame step).
