## TODO
- left, middle right click actions!
Great! You fixed everything except 5F Swipe Left /Right! 5-finger swipe used to be PERFECT when triggering Typing toggle but now it's busted. =x It appears to understand we are using a gesture 'gest' and it sees 5 contacts so I'm not sure why it is not triggering correctly. 
---
- export /import keymaps, load global.json default
- capture / replay .atpcap
- autocorrect bugging.
- auto-reconnect not working
- more realtime haptics? it still feels bad.
- Short drag sometimes fires click (Lifting fingers dispatches keys)
###
- normalize % to px??
- Have Codex refactor the GUI for effiency
- Have Codex redesign the GUI for looks, keeping efficiency
###
- "Auto" set column x,y based on finger splay "4 finger touch" snapsMetro.
