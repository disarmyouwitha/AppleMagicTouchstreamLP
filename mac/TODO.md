## TODO
- PRETTIFY ACTION DROP DOWN
-------
### Gesture config:
- Create dropdown for each of my gestures and implement them as actions that can be selected from a drop down. (You can reference ../windows/glasstokey if you need!)
- Left / Right / Double Click actions in Action Dropdown
-------
- Implement Auto Splay
- Implement e v e n s p a c i n g
-------
- export /import keymaps, **load GLASSTOKEY_DEFAULT_KEYMAP.json (package with app) if no keymap is saved.
- autocorrect bugging (lets go symspell)
- * far future - keymap import/export on windows/osx interop?
- Fix Planck layout
- auto-reconnect not working?
- Short drag sometimes fires click
- not sure it should be able to go into gesture mode during typing intent/typing grace
- sometimes click types letters (Lifting fingers after tap)
###
# HUGE:
- normalize %!??
- normalize keymap for 6x3 5x3 where it looks the same minus outer column.
###
- "Autosplay" set column x,y based on finger splay "4 finger touch" snapsMetro.
- e v e n s p a c e
