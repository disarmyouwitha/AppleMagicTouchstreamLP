## TODO
- Can we wire up "Capture" and "Replay" into the menu to capture and replay .atpcaps? We need to support ATPCAP_V3.
- Please explain to me how haptics works in the framework. Is this portable to windows in any way? Do you think it would be possible to implement in windows by reverse engineering?
---
- export /import keymaps, load global.json default
- autocorrect bugging (lets go symspell)
- auto-reconnect not working?
- Short drag sometimes fires click
- not sure it should be able to go into gesture mode during typing intent/typing grace
- sometimes click types letters (Lifting fingers after tap)
###
- normalize %!??
- normalize keymap for 6x3 5x3 where it looks the same minus outer column.
###
- "Autosplay" set column x,y based on finger splay "4 finger touch" snapsMetro.
- e v e n s p a c e

- Replay genius: If you want, I can also add replay hotkeys (Space play/pause, arrow keys frame step).
