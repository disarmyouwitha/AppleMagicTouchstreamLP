## TODO
- Can we add colored highlights like "Shortcut Buiilder" for each of the Gesture sub-collapsables? Can you make them each different colors?
- ^ Then I want to decide on a better theme for Shorcut Builder I hate that blue, lol. Its so un-mac looking..
- Add gestures (and collapsable sub-menu) to Gesture Tuning: Corners, Clicks, Force Clicks, Triangles
- Can we make Gesture Tuning section scrollable??
- ms cadence for gestures
-------
- Shift on same hand is broken.. 2-finger hold/2-finger tap related??
- right click bugs bc 3 finger drag, lets fix!

    
## TODO:
- Chordal shift is broken on RHS.
---
- hold repeat
- auto-reconnect not working correctly after sleep
- .atpcap should capture keymap! that would be super helpful!
---

## ICONIC:
- Need a logo for glasstokey!
- Start transition from Circles to Triangles

## Issues: (verify) [Still an issue?]
- Short drag sometimes fires click
- sometimes 2-finger scrolling types letters (Lifting fingers after drag)
- sometimes tap-click types letters (Lifting fingers after tap)
