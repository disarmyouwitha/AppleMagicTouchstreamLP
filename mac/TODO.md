## TODO
[0] Can we move “Layout” dropdown out of the “Column Tuning” section and put it right above it? [1] Instead of having Scale, X, Y, Pad (Column Tuning fields) hidden/visible depending on if a column is clicked - Can we have them always visible, but make Column Tyning collapsable?
[2] Can we have "Primary Action" and "Hold Action" always visible in Keymap Tuning, but make Keymap Tuning collapsable?
