## TODO:
- If you change layer MO(1) or TO(1) the Circle in the Taskbar should turn blue!
- Rename AmtPtpVisualizer > GlassToKey (update AGENTS.md, README.md, Taskbar.. everywhere!)
- Revisit tap-click.. it feels awful. Settings? Maybe 2-finger and 3-finger hold to trigger click??
- Add force cut off into GUI and settings. Make pressure over cutoff disqualify key dispatch
- typing tuning, key layout, mode toggles - these should be expandable (and set to collapsed) in the GUI
- Add "capture" and "replay" into the taskbar dropdown
- replay still doesnt work. I don't think we need to dispatch keys exatcly but it doesnt show highlight of keys either.
- When I change the device in the dropdown it stops responding
- autoreconnect? (yellow circle) and add to taskbar dropdown
- Autocorrect: spelljam? symjam? Windows variant?
- Voice mode: "windows siri/dictation" or use whipserX?
- REFACTOR=

## CURSED:
- HAPTICS: Not sure if I can get codex to figure it out, I certainly cant.
