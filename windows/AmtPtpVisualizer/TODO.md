## TODO:
- * TRAY: Then Rename AmtPtpVisualizer > GlassToKey (update AGENTS.md, README.md, etc!)
- Add force cut off, wire into GUI and settings. Make pressure over cutoff disqualify key dispatch
- typing tuning, key layout, mode toggles - these should be expandable (and set to collapsed) in the GUI
- replay still doesnt work. I don't think we need to dispatch keys exatcly but it doesnt show highlight of keys either.
- When I change the device in the dropdown it stops responding
- STATUS BAR APP - CODEX.5.3.high rewrite
- REFACTOR
- autoreconnect?
- Taps between keys stick the fingers on visualizer sometimes?
- Autocorrect
- Rename to GlassToKey instead of AmtPtpVizualizer
- Autocorrect: spelljam? symjam? Windows variant?
- Voice mode: "windows siri/dictation" or use whipserX?

## CURSED:
- HAPTICS: Not sure if I can get codex to figure it out, I certainly cant.
