## TODO:
- keyboard mode should swallow clicks globally (except in the Visualizer app?)
- snap radius should work, and should be a toggle
- test snap radius changes. ** have it look at GTK? 
- HAPTICS BABY!
- Add force cut off, wire into GUI and settings. Make pressure over cutoff disqualify key dispatch
- typing tuning, key layout, mode toggles - these should be expandable (and set to collapsed) in the GUI
- replay still doesnt work. I don't think we need to dispatch keys exatcly but it doesnt show highlight of keys either.
- I can see when I type that we remain in TypingCommited status instead of going back to idle, even after typing grace. Can you make sure the State logic matches OSX/GlassToKey/GlassToKey?
- When I change the device in the dropdown it stops responding
- STATUS BAR APP - CODEX.5.3.high rewrite
- REFACTOR
- autoreconnect?
- Taps between keys stick the fingers on visualizer sometimes?
- Autocorrect
