 Oh is the strength something we can set to whatever we want? I thought it was locked into certain values that we can send? What I experience is [0] the Haptics on Key dispatch is AWESOME! [1] The Haptics slider: Off is good! Low = HIGH haptics. Med = HIGH haptics. High = LOW haptics, so something is not right. [2] Can you make an OFFICIAL_HAPTICS.md with all of the information other reverse engineers would need to figure it out in their projects? [3] When both trackpads are using USB and the official driver haptics only trigger on the LHS pad. Need per-device haptic routing. RHS taps are causing LHS haptics!

[] When using 1 device over USB and 1 over Bluetooth, both on the official drivers, if I connect to USB first, then I can no longer select the Bluetooth device from the list.. it immediately swaps to USB. 

[] when I have 1 official and 1 opensource plugged in via USB I can only see the opensource one? Seems like there are device list inconsistencies?? When this happens the Opensource device will trigger haptics on the other device ** lets check this after we figure out per-device haptics
