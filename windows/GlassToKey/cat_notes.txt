In the GUI can we remove "Pressed:" true/false from the GUI overlay? Can we add "Peak: in it's place where we display the last highest force? (I want to be able to see how hard the keyboard was tapped or clicked)

Can we wire a "force cap" slider into the GUI? (using new variable) /test

Can we wire a "force min" slider into the GUI? (using new variable) /test

^ These will both be in phase1, so, slider can be 0-255

**Gestures** "click", Force click1, Force Click2.
