Great! It sounds like we have enough info to implement this: In 'force dbg' can you show a calculation of P+Ph scale 0-985, if that makes sense? like 0-255 for each phase 1-3 then 220 for the last phase?

Can we set a variable for that like p and ph?

Can we wire a "force cap" slider into the GUI? (using new variable) /test

Can we wire a "force min" slider into the GUI? (using new variable) /test

^ These will both be in phase1

**Gestures** "click", Force click1, Force Click2.
