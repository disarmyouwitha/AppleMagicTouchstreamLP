## TODO:
- Can we add "double-click" action that fires 2 clicks quickly? 
- Can we add Volumn Up and Volume down?
- What other actions could we add??
- Can we make the action dropdown a searchable dropdown? Is there a better way to display this info in such a small area?
---
- Can we make the max scaling of the Trackpad devices in the GUI match the physical diminsions of the apple magic trackpad2? (Look it up) I think that will give us more room to add to the GUI!
------- 
- Autocorrect: spelljam? symjam? **ISpellCheckerFactory → ISpellChecker**
- Is typing... bad? lol. Try Keyboard mode and see if it's any better.. Snap radius on first hit?
- 2/3 finger tap gestures~
-------
- `Resting Fingers` Mode: allow ppl to put their fingers on the keyboard and tap 1 at a time to emit the key.
- ^ In this mode we ignore gesture intent, etc so that dispatch is based only on force (TRY IN KEYBOARD MODE?!)
---
- REFACTOR

## FUTURE:
- `Gesture as a modifier state`: 5-finger hold RHS (Gesture State) + 3-finger swipe LHS moves arrow keys L/R (settable)
- `Handed Gestures`: Create Gestures (Left) and Gestures (Right) and make the gestures handed, instead of duplicate
- `Advanced Gestures Config` as it's own GUI like Config? (more breathing room to make the GUI more usable)
