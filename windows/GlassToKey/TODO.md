## TODO:
- Revisit tap-click.. it feels awful. Settings? Maybe 2-finger and 3-finger hold to trigger click??
- Autocorrect: spelljam? symjam? Windows variant?
- Voice mode: "windows siri/dictation" (Win+H Dictation) + ESC to close window
- REFACTOR
---
## Gesture Config:
- Shows available gestures: ("Tap Gestures") 2-finger tap, 3-finger tap ("Swipe Gestures") 5-finger swiper L/R ("Hold Gestures") 4-finger hold
- Allow user to select their own action for a gesture from a pre-formed list: Typing Toggle, Chordal Shift, or allow them to select a regular Action from the drop-down

## Worth it?
- Add force cut off into GUI and settings. Make pressure over cutoff disqualify key dispatch
- Only worth persuing Pressure if we can get Haptics to work, I think

## CURSED:
- HAPTICS: Not sure if I can get codex to figure it out, I certainly cant.
