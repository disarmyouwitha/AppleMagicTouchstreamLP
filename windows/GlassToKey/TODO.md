## TODO: 
- Export / import / saving is not working as expected
- Are the current defaults hardcoded in? Could you set them to match my current export GLASSTOKEY_DEFAULT_KEYMAP.json
- Remove "auto" decoder from the code since we are using a drop-down now. (unless it's really problematic)
- Add left / right click as actions
- Mobile should make LHS:blank + RHS: all QWERTY keys on 1 side
- LHS: I can't hold shift and press another key (It only takes the first tap?) lol
- Revisit tap-click.. it feels awful. Settings? Maybe 2-finger and 3-finger hold to trigger click??
- replay still doesnt work. I don't think we need to dispatch keys exatcly but it doesnt show highlight of keys either.
- Add "capture" and "replay" into the taskbar dropdown
- Pretty sections for Action dropdown? nums ___ letters ___ symbols
- autoreconnect? (yellow circle) and add to taskbar dropdown
- Autocorrect: spelljam? symjam? Windows variant?
- Voice mode: "windows siri/dictation" or use whipserX?
- REFACTOR

## Worth it?
- Only worth persuing Pressure if we can get Haptics to work, I think
- Add force cut off into GUI and settings. Make pressure over cutoff disqualify key dispatch

## CURSED:
- HAPTICS: Not sure if I can get codex to figure it out, I certainly cant.
