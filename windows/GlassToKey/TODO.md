## TODO:
- Revisit tap-click.. it feels awful. Settings? Maybe 2-finger and 3-finger hold to trigger click??
- autoreconnect? (yellow circle) and add to taskbar dropdown
- Autocorrect: spelljam? symjam? Windows variant?
- Voice mode: "windows siri/dictation" or use whipserX?
- REFACTOR

## Worth it?
- Add force cut off into GUI and settings. Make pressure over cutoff disqualify key dispatch
- Only worth persuing Pressure if we can get Haptics to work, I think

## CURSED:
- HAPTICS: Not sure if I can get codex to figure it out, I certainly cant.
