## Gestures
- How hard would it be for you to write something to automaticaly take a capture and make a gesture, just like you did? 

**Ph  based:** Force click1 (ph:1), Force Click2 (ph:2)
**Click/Force Click Corners??** upper-left,upper-right,lower-left,lower-right corner

## TODO:
- 3-finger taps do not trigger well.. can you help me out?
- Can we add a 3-finger hold gesture?
- Revisit tap-click.. it feels awful. Settings? Maybe 2-finger and 3-finger hold to trigger click??
- ^^^ This has to be next bro, lol.
^^ Tap clicks don't put us in `gest` ??
-------
- Double check intent state on Windows for Mixed
- Autocorrect: spelljam? symjam? **ISpellCheckerFactory → ISpellChecker**
- Voice mode Gestue (Outer Corners): "windows siri/dictation" (Win+H Dictation) + ESC to close window
- REFACTOR
- [Resting Fingers mode]: allow ppl to put their fingers on the keyboard and tap 1 at a time to emit the key.
- ^ In this mode we ignore gesture intent, etc so that dispatch is based only on force (TRY IN KEYBOARD MODE!)
