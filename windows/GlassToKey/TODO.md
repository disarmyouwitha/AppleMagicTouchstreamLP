## TODO:
- I want to try something experimental, can we add an "auto splay" button, the idea being that you would put 4 fingers down on 1 side and click the button and it would snap all of the middle columns (In 6x3 this would be columns 2,3,4,5) to the X,Y of each of those fingers. Column 1 can match Column 2 with an X-offset. Column 6 can match column 5 with an X-offset)
- Revisit tap-click.. it feels awful. Settings? Maybe 2-finger and 3-finger hold to trigger click??
- Autocorrect: spelljam? symjam? Windows variant?
- Voice mode: "windows siri/dictation" or use whipserX?
- REFACTOR

## Worth it?
- Add force cut off into GUI and settings. Make pressure over cutoff disqualify key dispatch
- Only worth persuing Pressure if we can get Haptics to work, I think

## CURSED:
- HAPTICS: Not sure if I can get codex to figure it out, I certainly cant.
