## TODO:
- Can we add 2-finger and 3-finger hold gestures to the "Hold Gestures" section? 2 and 3 finger hold gestures should trigger when the user keeps the specified number of fingers on the board for Hold(ms) multifinger_hold.atpcap
- 2 and 3-finger taps do not trigger well.. can you help me out? Stagger? Recording?
- Revisit tap-click.. it feels awful. Settings? Maybe 2-finger and 3-finger hold to trigger click??
- ^^^ This has to be next bro, lol.
-------
- Autocorrect: spelljam? symjam? **ISpellCheckerFactory → ISpellChecker**
- `Voice mode` Gesture:  (Win+H Dictation) + ESC to close window on closing gesture.
- `Resting Fingers` Mde: allow ppl to put their fingers on the keyboard and tap 1 at a time to emit the key.
- ^ In this mode we ignore gesture intent, etc so that dispatch is based only on force (TRY IN KEYBOARD MODE?!)

- REFACTOR
