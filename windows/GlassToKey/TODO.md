## TODO:
- Is typing... bad? lol. Try Keyboard mode and see if it's any better.. Snap radius on first hit?
- Can we add "double-click" action that fires 2 clicks quickly? 
- What other actions could we add?? 
- Remove Tap Gestures: 2/3 finger tap from GUI/backend. Remove Tap stagger, tap cadence, tap move  threshold from Typing tuning. If you are Tapping.. you are Typing!
- 2 and 3-finger taps do not trigger well.. can you help me out? Stagger? Recording?
- ^^^ This has to be next bro, lol.
-------
- 3-finger swipe up/down left/right
- 4-finger swipe up/down left/right
- Autocorrect: spelljam? symjam? **ISpellCheckerFactory → ISpellChecker**
- `Resting Fingers` Mde: allow ppl to put their fingers on the keyboard and tap 1 at a time to emit the key.
- ^ In this mode we ignore gesture intent, etc so that dispatch is based only on force (TRY IN KEYBOARD MODE?!)
---
- REFACTOR

## FUTURE:
- `Gesture as a modifier state`: 5-finger hold RHS (Gesture State) + 3-finger swipe LHS moves arrow keys L/R (settable)
- `Handed Gestures`: Create Gestures (Left) and Gestures (Right) and make the gestures handed, instead of duplicated
